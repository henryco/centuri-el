# centuri.el 
### Center any content in any buffer in Emacs27+

#### Features:
- Dynamically recalculates content on buffer resize
- Works in terminal mode
- Customizable
- Just **M-x `centuri-mode`**

```
Enable centuri-mode and your text is going to be centered.
This is LOCAL mode, so the effect does not apply to other buffers.
See group "centuri"
```
